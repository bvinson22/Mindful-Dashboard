# Mindful Dashboard

## Why? 
I wanted to create a dashboard that was useful for my everyday life. I really enjoy counting down until my next trip, so I thought it would be cool to incorporate this into my dashboard. I also experimented with random pictures which was also fun and I would love to add more pictures from my personal collection in the future.
